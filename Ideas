Megaman esque roguelike
broguelike
every level beatable from the start
some harder than others
single item achievable per level
each item helps in a different area
either through broguelike movement bonus's to attack or ability to abuse enemy AI
Yeah an ability to abuse the enemy AI IF you figure it out
Each level themed
procedural generation
healing?
wait based?
bloodwort esque?
potions?
Same generation of bonus items?
scrolls and potions?
yeah
No equipment
only scrolls an potions
equipment all boss level drops
CAN get weakened but only 1 lvl
Starts at Enchanted->Normal->Weakened

NO wait Starts at Normal can get Weakened and can be enchanted
not enough scrolls to enchant everything
start with stick and shirt so an early enchant scroll goes into something
 Bonus Enchant scroll goes from weakened straight to enchanted
